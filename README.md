# Dhaka-MRT-Timetable

Unofficial Dhaka MRT-6 Time schedule through a web application. This is a self-made unofficial timetable of trains arriving at all the stations. You can check the raw data for yourself in `mrt-6.json`. This JSON file was generated through observation of arrival and departure times of the stations between Uttara Center and Farmgate from my morning commute. There could be a Â±1 minute error on the given time. If you happen to come across any irregularities in a time for a station, report it through the issues tab.

## Demo

You can view the web application hosted on GitHub Pages [here](https://your-username.github.io/Dhaka-MRT-Timetable/).

## Features

- View the current local time in Bangladesh.
- Select your current station from a dropdown menu.
- View the next three trains towards Motijheel and Uttara North.
- Toggle between light and dark mode.
- View the number of times the page has been visited.
- Access the repository and the developer's GitHub profile from the menu.
